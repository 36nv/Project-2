**Assignment: Flutter App Development - Global Data Management**

**Objective:**
This assignment is designed to showcase your proficiency in Flutter app development, with a specific focus on understanding Flutter's architecture, project structure, widgets, global data management, and data manipulation concepts.

**Requirements:**
Your task is to create a Flutter app that demonstrates global data management for a shopping list. The app should allow users to add, view, update, and remove items from their shopping list. Global data management should be used to efficiently store and manage the shopping list items.

**Tasks:**

1. **Flutter's Architecture and Structure**
   - Provide a concise explanation of Flutter's architecture, emphasizing its fundamental components like widgets and the rendering engine.
   - Describe the typical structure of a Flutter project, outlining the main directories and essential files that compose it.

2. **Creating a Flutter Project**
   - Set up a new Flutter project named "ShoppingListApp" with the appropriate configuration.
   - Customize the initial layout of the app to include a welcoming message and an icon.

3. **Widgets Implementation**
   - Design the user interface of the app using appropriate widgets to display the shopping list and input fields for adding new items.

4. **Global Data Management**
   - Implement a robust global data management mechanism using either the Provider or Bloc pattern to ensure consistent handling of the shopping list items throughout the app.

5. **Models and Data Manipulation**
   - Develop a model class named "ShoppingItem" to represent a shopping item entity with properties such as name, quantity, and status (purchased or not).
   - Implement necessary functions to add new items, update item status, and remove items from the global data.

6. **Retrieve Data, Update Data, and Remove Data**
   - Display the shopping list from the global data in a ListView widget on the home screen.
   - Implement functionality to update the status of an item (mark as purchased) and ensure that the changes are accurately reflected in the shopping list.
   - Allow users to remove an item from the list by performing a long press on the respective item.

7. **GitHub Submission**
   - Create a public GitHub repository for your "ShoppingListApp" and consistently commit your code.
   - Ensure that the repository is accessible and available for review by the submission deadline.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- You have a total of 3 days to complete the assignment, starting from the date of receipt.
- Regularly commit and push your code to the GitHub repository before the submission deadline.
- Include a README.md file in the repository, providing clear instructions on how to build and run the app.
- Share the link to your GitHub repository as your final submission.

**Note:** While developing the app, prioritize demonstrating your understanding of Flutter's architecture, global data management, and data manipulation concepts. If time permits, feel free to enhance the user interface and add extra features to showcase your creativity. Good luck with your assignment!

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completion: The project will be evaluated based on how well it fulfills the specified requirements.
- Quality: Your code will be assessed for its overall quality, including coding style, organization, and ease of maintenance.
- Use of Programming Concepts: The effective utilization of Flutter widgets, data handling techniques, Models, and other relevant concepts will be taken into account.

**Timeframe and Delivery:**
You are expected to complete the project within 3 days. The final version should be delivered through GitHub, providing an accessible and efficient method for reviewing and evaluating your work.

In conclusion, the "ShoppingListApp" will serve as a testament to your expertise in Flutter app development, as well as your mastery of global data management and data manipulation concepts.
