**Assignment: Flutter App Development - Global Data Management**

**Objective:** This assignment aims to demonstrate your proficiency in Flutter app development, specifically in areas such as architecture, project structure, widgets, global data management, and data manipulation.

**Requirements:**
Develop a To-Do List app using Flutter that allows users to add, view, update, and remove tasks. The app should employ global data management to store the tasks efficiently.

**Tasks:**

1. **Flutter's Architecture and Structure**
   - Provide a concise explanation of Flutter's architecture, emphasizing essential components like widgets and the rendering engine.
   - Describe the typical structure of a Flutter project, including main directories and crucial files.

2. **Creating a Flutter Project**
   - Set up a new Flutter project named "ToDoListApp" with the appropriate configuration.
   - Customize the app's initial layout to display a welcoming message and an icon.

3. **Widgets Implementation**
   - Design the app's user interface using appropriate widgets to present the task list and input fields for adding new tasks.

4. **Global Data Management**
   - Implement a global data management mechanism using either the Provider or Bloc pattern to handle the list of tasks consistently across the app.

5. **Models and Data Manipulation**
   - Develop a model class named "Task" to represent a task entity with properties like title, description, and status (completed or not).
   - Implement functions to add new tasks, update task status, and remove tasks from the global data.

6. **Retrieve Data, Update Data, and Remove Data**
   - Display the list of tasks from the global data in a ListView widget on the home screen.
   - Implement the functionality to update the status of a task (mark as completed) and reflect the changes in the task list.
   - Allow users to remove a task from the list by performing a long press on the task item.

7. **GitHub Submission**
   - Create a public GitHub repository for your "ToDoListApp" and regularly commit your code.
   - Ensure that the repository is accessible and available for review by the submission deadline.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- You have a total of 3 days to complete the assignment, starting from the date of receiving it.
- Consistently commit and push your code to the GitHub repository before the submission deadline.
- Include a README.md file in the repository, providing instructions on how to build and run the app.
- Share the link to your GitHub repository as your final submission.

**Note:** While developing the app, focus on demonstrating your understanding of Flutter's architecture, global data management, and data manipulation concepts. If time allows, you may enhance the user interface and add extra features. Good luck with your assignment!

**Evaluation Criteria:**


- Completion: The project will be assessed based on how well it meets the requirements.
- Quality: The project will be evaluated based on its quality, including coding style, organization, and ease of maintenance.
- Use of programming concepts: such as Flutter widgets, Handling data  and others.

**Timeframe and Delivery:**
You are expected to complete the project within 3 days. The final version should be delivered through GitHub, providing an accessible and efficient method for reviewing and evaluating your work.

In conclusion, the "ToDoListApp" will showcase your expertise in Flutter app development and your grasp of global data management and data manipulation concepts.
